You can see a lot of people around with stickers on their laptops. Many people use them just for esthetic purposes, but this is not the only reason. I like to stick stickers on my Mac Book Pro. I have covered lid with stickers that deliver certain message to others. Indeed, these small pieces of paper have some meanings for me. They reflect what I like, what I support and make my laptop look more bright, interesting and unique.

Very serious people think that stickers are childish and boring. I would not say so. Think about stickers on a laptop of programmer  as military medals on person’s chest. Every piece of paper say something about owner of the laptop: what are his favorite languages, frameworks, ideas, brands, movies; what he supports and what he is familiar with; or what meetups and conferences he has attended; what online services he prefer or what is his job. 

Stickers even help to establish communications between hackers. For example, when I attend meetups and conferences, very often I look for stickers on a person’s laptop, it helps me to find common interests and topics for conversation with this person. 

Recently, I installed Octopress blog and began to play around with it. It seems quite flexible and interesting system for me. Made with clean design, typography and modern principles in mind. There are a lot of plugins for Octopress. Nevertheless, I decide to write my own plugin for it.


### Let me introduce Stickers for Octopress ###

{% img right /images/octopress-stickers.png  %}

This is simple plugin, that helps you easily display and manage stickers (images) on your blog aside area.  In addition, you can link certain image to any other website. But the most powerful thing about this plugin is, that you don't need to do any configurations to add stickers after you installed plugin. All you need, is to place your sticker inside a special folder and plugin will automatically add and display your image on your blog. 

You can see the result of work of this plugin on this blog. 

Installation guide and details how to use it, you can find in [github repository](https://github.com/polinom/stickers-octopress) in REDME.md file.
Feel free to contribute. There are lot of things, that can be improved. I am not a ruby-developer, so don't expect perfect and optimised code.  

Youca can add your own stickers to the stickers database, so other people can use them too. Read the requirements in [README.md](https://github.com/polinom/stickers-octopress#sticker-database)

As a python-dev I’m kind of jealous that we don't have the same thing written with python language. Actually, there are some good ones, but Octopress is a great exemplar.
