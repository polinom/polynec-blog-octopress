  I develop  web applications using Python language, Django framework and JavaScript. In addition, I love to play with many other novelties, like NoSQL databases, frontend MVC frameworks and various programming languages, most of all, related to the WEB. I like to fly and to fix RC airplanes, this is one of my recent hobbies that will not last long, I assume. Photograpy is another one of my new hobbies. You can check my works out on [500px](http://500px.com/IgorPolinec  "I believe these are art works "). Dont be very critical because I'm just learning.  

  Currently I live in Canada, Toronto city.  Originally from the west part Ukraine, Transcarpathian region. 

  I am very interested in psychology, philosophy, politics, business management and science in general. I support ideology of decentralisation. It is very interesting concept that you can observe and apply in such places as nature, economic system, politics and technology. The reason why I am so passionate about these things I will probably explain in one of my future articles that I want to write.
